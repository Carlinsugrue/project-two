<h4>Week 1</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
<p>
    After careful deliberation I have decided I would like to move from the Systems and Security group to join the FarmBot project this semester if at all feasible. Although I feel the skills I would acquire from remaining in the operations group could be more effective in a plethora of jobs when graduating, I can’t help pass the opportunity to work on an idea I have personally been interested in creating on my own. I love the concept of full automation and it was my hope to one day develop automated agricultural systems within my own business. It’s a difficult choice as I feel like I am letting down my project leader again by abandoning the CodeLingo efforts, although I was about as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike I was the only one looking at the materials since last semester. Even through my hardware skills are rudimentary and the task is a daunting one, I feel I may approach it with much more gumption than my previous semester.

<h4>Week 2</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
<p>
    By the grace of any of the myriad gods (Adon I suppose in this case) I was permitted to jump into the Farmbot project! Meet with the other team members, some whom had previously worked on the preliminary stages wasted no time in conveying all that had been completed. A lot to be done! But the team seem like a real bunch of roosters and keen to see this through.

    so getting back into the swing of things we each threw out some suggestions on what we should be doing to further the farmbot project. The server side of things seemed to be primarily the only thing apart from the shopping list that could be started immediately. so being the project 2 student that had previously done some server stuff i grabbed Sam whom had previously worked on the server and we started to familiarize and re-familiarize ourselves with the software. seems as though it has updated substantially since Sam's time, so a complete re-implementation sounds like a good start.
</p>

<h4>Week 3</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
<p>
    So i was able to throw up an instance of Farmbot Inc's WebApp on the polytechnic staging pool with thanks to the extremely helpful lee in operations and security. This unfortunately, was not without its foibles. as is there seems to be a problem with the inherent CSP protections on default browsers such as chrome and Firefox that dose not allow the user to run JS files within the window, perhaps also steaming from the lack of HTTPS currently employed. No matter, a couple settings disabled and the first page is visible! next hurdle required some config hunting to re jig the web-kit development environment to serve content to the IP address and not localhost. so its sort of working... a bit rickety so I'm not optimistic on how the Raspberry PI is going to go...
</p>
<img src="photos/" class="img-responsive" alt="">

<h4>Week 4</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
<p>
    Alright, this wasn't exactly a surprise, although, i did intend on seeing the Raspberry PI connect to the Farmbot hosted servers. throughout the day me and Sam have to no avail been able to connect the PI up to either server. first obstacle being that of the wifi and its single sign on predicament, as the PI needs to use the OP network but cant log onto the network with a specific users credentials. Sam in his experience informs me that the guest network is also not an option. another band-aid can be placed on this briefly with the use of Ethernet although i doubt anyone wants to run a cable from D block to the garden. I suppose its time to brainstorm a bit.

<h4>Week 5</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
<p>
    As required in this Project we are to complete 4 Professional development activities. For my first I decided to see what the all the hoopla surrounding the CodeCraft meet up was about. professional indeed i could barely keep up with most of the talks in progress, but there were some great presentations and knowledgeable peoples dishing out some intriguing take home messages. first a man representing NZ Tech spoke of the organization and how it was enveloping many tech companies in Christchurch and the north island and extended invitations to any Dunedin companies interested. the next was a perplexing talk on self written modules in JavaScript for websites (most if not all went above my head) the last presentation educated us on whether or not re writing your code on older projects is worth the effort once certain considerations are taken into account. Certainly a great environment to get amongst, not just for the presentations offered but the amount of IT professionals present in the room would prove for amazing networking, help and support in whatever project you had underway.

    * implemented new version of server to fix XSS issues

<h4>Week 6</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
<p>
    * do epicenter orientation course
    * go to epicenter with laiken and the file types to discuss printing and aluminum parts.
    * after thinking it may be a MQTT protocol issue me and Sam connect the Raspberry pi!

    * went to get 3d printed parts and see the tiny parts (picture)
    * retrieve some aluminum parts anyway
    * start to see Farmbot come together
    * still need heaps of materials though
</p>

<h4>Week 8</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
<p>
    * made a farmbot blog for the others and myself to add content to
    * went with rob to talk about placing the garden bed.
    * also went with rob to talk to the council about funding - to no avail
</p>
<img src="photos/" class="img-responsive" alt="">
<hr>

<h4>Week 9</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
<p>
    * still waiting on funding and fundamental parts for server and Farmbot operation i hook up the raspberry pi to the server then connect the mega to a breadboard full of l.e.d's in hopes of understanding which digipins correlate with what Farmbot action be it movement or peripheral operation.
    * finding connecting the mega and pi to server exceedingly difficult very unsure which link of the chain is going wrong.

<h4>Week 13</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
<p>
    * Knew that in terms of work commitment i had been laking in the holidays and was set on delivering more quality and quantity of work in the next half of the semester.
    * me and Sonny were plucked from the project room and sat in the meeting room and given a rather intriguing proposition to build boxie.
    * Adon and Vaughn suggest the idea and making it with micro-controllers and raspberry pi, i go back to the project room brainstorm some ideas on how this can work on some pad and on the net. I realize we are going to need a bunch of extra things like camera, lights, speaker etc. Understanding with first hand experience how there is no room in the time frame for that kind of budgeting or build operation i raise the point of using a red bot and android smart phone to work in tandem. I feel i warm everyone up to the idea because it makes the job more realistic in the timeframe. we start to work on that idea.

<h4>Week 14</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
<p>
    * throught the weekend i work on an intresting way to utilise all the smartphones inbuild sensers such as the facetracker app.
    * meet with nigel the man who prompted the groups creation to guage what he would like.
    * PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT talk with the farmbot group to students as they walk in about the project.

<h4>Week 15</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
<p>
    * nighn and sonny already spearheading the redbot code, seeing as it is pretty trivial i leave it to there capable hands.
    * me and sonny start work on a prototype body for boxie. its pretty bad but we get a good vibe for what we need.
    * im having some difficulty figuring out how to hold the phone and open it back up again. salvation comes when shortening Farmbot stepper motor box.
</p>
<img src="photos/" class="img-responsive" alt="">

<h4>Week 16</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
<p>
    * all is going well when me and sonny think we find a pretty good way of meeting the body requirements for boxie with some spare boxes in the project room and spare polystyrene inserts.
    * as boxie moves about the pen Adon gets excited and throws us another curve ball when he asks for a swiveling head, we say thats easy and sonny slaps a servo on and we fashion out a place for it. hey presto it works, until it decapitates itself with its own momentum. hopefully some strong super-glue will do the trick.
    * things look like they are falling into place unexpectedly well.
    * Murphys law, seems like everything goes wrong code wise, sonny and nighn are having some conflicts over the code, honestly i think its a bit dangerous to throw my hat into the ring when everyones wound up so tight. so i leave it until the next day where i can slap the bot together and put it up for display.
    * turns out nighn the poor dude hasn't slept in like days! but things seem to be working for the most part, although the servo is going haywire. with time a precious commodity i slap the glue on in hopes of a strong bond and bound down to the hub. head falls off almost immediately, im sweating profusely and run boxie back down to the hardware room where i glue the head mounts straight onto the body.
    * after all my apologies to the group the day seemed to go alright, we actually produced something and im proud of everyone for doing what they did.

<h4>Week 17</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">

    * after a month its back to the old axe and grindstone, we find out from the other farmbot memebers that it happend to be the arduino mega causing the difficault connectivity complications. so we all throw up the server and get sam to sweet talk the raspberry pi to communicate to each comkputer. seems to start working a bit but its main functions remain a locked mystery to us.
    * adon updates me on whats happening with the boxie or "DOT" robot. turns out were going to refine and show it off at showcase in a few weeks  time. Oh lord, i hope it goes better this time.
    * sidenote he also asks me to show some of the web 3 visualization site. - no problem... hopefully

<h4>Week 18</h4>

<p>
    * So I come back and adon seems to have advised and implemeted with nighn my old deadman switch idea for boxie, im a big fan. not only does it free up the light sensor problems i suggested the idea a month ago :3, enough self praise aside it works much better despite a few foibles associated with the new code. we all start to look at it and throw in our 2 cents we come up with some more refined states for DOT's stop and drive function.
    * I construct a new head for DOT as the other one is looking very decrepit. its getting more difficult to find cardboard, I'm very glad we had adopted the android and red bot system or else we wouldn't have gotten anywhere near to the tech expo due to lack of funding to even buy glue sticks or cardboard.

<h4>Week 19</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
<p>
    * PROFFESIONAL DEVELOPMENT i did the diversity course.
    * things never go swimmingly for long, Adon swags into the room suggests another box for a cleaner design, i agree, suggesting to revitalize the existing box as it is now a tailor fit for the hot glued mess of the red bot. I avert my gaze for mere seconds (rookie mistake) only to regain visual contact with the now mutilated cardboard box. As i clutch the desecrated remains of DOT's body Adon laughs maniacally, slowly descending into a fiery pentagram now etched into the project rooms floor, he recites an omelette idiom.
    * So i get to work on the new body and it turns out okay, Adon was right, it looks a lot cleaner.
    * i fashion up some more cardboard peripherals to help contain the batteries on the back of dot, and attach the new head to the new servo mount with glue. I sure hope it remains attached, its really quite hard to find a structurally sound solution to something made of thin cardboard.
