<h4>Week 1</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
<p>
    After careful deliberation I have decided I would like to move from the Systems and Security group to join the FarmBot project this semester if at all feasible. Although I feel the skills I would acquire from remaining in the operations group could be more effective in a plethora of jobs when graduating, I can’t help pass the opportunity to work on an idea I have personally been interested in creating on my own. I love the concept of full automation and it was my hope to one day develop automated agricultural systems within my own business. It’s a difficult choice as I feel like I am letting down my project leader again by abandoning the CodeLingo efforts, although I was about as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike I was the only one looking at the materials since last semester. Even though my hardware skills are rudimentary and the task is a daunting one, I feel I may approach it with much more gumption than my previous semester.

<h4>Week 2</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
<p>
    By the grace of any of the myriad gods (Adon I suppose in this case) I was permitted to jump into the Farmbot project! Meet with the other team members, some whom had previously worked on the preliminary stages wasted no time in conveying all that had been completed. A lot to be done! But the team seem like a real bunch of roosters and keen to see this through.

    so getting back into the swing of things we each threw out some suggestions on what we should be doing to further the Farmbot project. The server side of things seemed to be primarily the only thing apart from the shopping list that could be started immediately, so being the project 2 student that had previously done some server stuff I grabbed Sam whom had already worked on the server in software engineering and we started to familiarize and re-familiarize ourselves with the software. Seems as though it has updated substantially since Sam's time, so a complete re-implementation sounds like a good start.
</p>

<h4>Week 3</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
<p>
    So I was able to throw up another instance of Farmbot Inc's WebApp on the polytechnic staging pool with thanks to the extremely helpful lee in operations and security. This unfortunately, was not without its foibles. As is there seems to be a problem with the inherent CSP protections on default browsers such as chrome and Firefox that dose not allow the user to run JS files within the window, perhaps also stemming from the lack of HTTPS currently employed by the web-app in its current form. No matter, a couple settings disabled and the first page is visible! next hurdle required some config hunting to re jig the web-kit development environment to serve content to the IP address and not localhost. so its sort of working... a bit rickety so I'm not optimistic on how the Raspberry PI is going to go...
</p>
<img src="photos/" class="img-responsive" alt="">
<hr>
<h4>Week 4</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
<p>
    Alright, this wasn't exactly a surprise, although, I did intend on at the very least seeing the Raspberry PI connect to the Farmbot hosted servers. Throughout the day me and Sam have to no avail been able to connect the PI up to either server. first obstacle being that of the OP WIFI network and its single sign on predicament, as the PI needs to use the OP intranet but cant log onto the network with a specific users credentials. Sam in his software engineering experience informs me that the guest network is also not an option. another band-aid can be placed on this briefly with the use of the PI's Ethernet port, although I doubt anyone wants to run a cable from D block to the garden. I suppose its time to brainstorm a bit.
</p>

<h4>Week 5</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
    <p>As required in this Project we are to complete 4 Professional development activities. For my first I decided to see what all the hoopla surrounding the CodeCraft meet up was about. Professional indeed I could barely keep up with most of the talks in progress, but there were some great presentations and knowledgeable peoples dishing out some intriguing take home messages. First a man representing NZ Tech spoke of the organization and how it was enveloping many tech companies in Christchurch and the north island and extended invitations to any Dunedin companies interested. The next was a perplexing talk on self written modules in JavaScript for websites (most if not all went above my head) the last presentation educated us on whether or not re writing your code on older projects is worth the effort once certain considerations are taken into account. Certainly a great environment to get amongst, not just for the presentations offered but the amount of IT professionals present in the room would prove for amazing networking, help and support in whatever project you had underway.</p>
    <p>So as it turns out Farmbot Inc update their software regularly. Keeping true to their word of open-source software (Hardwares a different story) luckily we weren't the only ones having cross site scripting browser issues and the issue was resolved promptly after making adjustments to their webpack implementation. After a good ol' fresh from the press instillation was complete the web-app was golden, although its still early days to say anything in regards to the raspberry pi connectivity.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile in the background of the Farmbot lair keys collided with fingertips to produce a mass of documents outlining hardware specifications and the costs associated, this, we knew, was going to be the largest challenge the group would face, budget restrictions.</p>

<h4>Week 6</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
    <p>To circumvent some of our budgeting problems we spoke to Epicenter over in Engineering block to help us create some aluminum parts and 3D printed peripherals. After a short volley of emails our project leader Rob had set up a time in which I would accompany him in talking to the heads of Epicenter. First however there was a small course that needed completing, preaching the safety precautions that must be adhered to within the building. with the precursor paperwork completed we discussed Farmbots needs and the ways in which we could utilize epicenters help.</p>
    <p>Employing Laiken to accompany me to the engineering block as he had been viewing and archiving the various auto-cad files associated with the manufacture of Farmbot, we handed over the files and Epicenter got under way.</p>
    <p>After some strenuous configuration and thinking it may be a MQTT protocol issue associated with OP's network me and Sam finally connect the Raspberry pi! As great as this is we still don't have anything else relating to the electronic hardware that communicates through the server such as the motors/drivers/ramps shield.</p>

<h4>Week 7</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
    <p>* went to get 3d printed parts and see the tiny parts (picture)</p>
    <p>* retrieve some aluminum parts anyway</p>
    <p>* start to see Farmbot come together</p>
    <p>* still need heaps of materials though</p>
<img src="photos/" class="img-responsive" alt="">
<hr>

<h4>Week 8</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
    <p>* made a farmbot blog for the others and myself to add content to</p>
    <p>* went with rob to talk about placing the garden bed.</p>
    <p>* also went with rob to talk to the council about funding - to no avail</p>
<img src="photos/" class="img-responsive" alt="">
<hr>

<h4>Week 9</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
    <p>* still waiting on funding and fundamental parts for server and Farmbot operation I hook up the raspberry pi to the server then connect the mega to a breadboard full of l.e.d's in hopes of understanding which digipins correlate with what Farmbot action be it movement or peripheral operation.</p>
    <p>* finding connecting the mega and pi to server exceedingly difficult very unsure which link of the chain is going wrong. </p>
<img src="photos/" class="img-responsive" alt="">
<hr>

<h4>Week 10</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
    <p>* Still having difficult time connecting server with the pi and mega</p>
    <p>* go to Dunedin startup weekend with rob and Cade.</p>
<img src="photos/" class="img-responsive" alt="">

<h4>Week 11</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
<p>* HOLIDAYS - Worked on WEB 3</p>

<h4>Week 13</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
    <p>* Knew that in terms of work commitment I had been laking in the holidays and was set on delivering more quality and quantity of work in the next half of the semester.</p>
    <p>* me and Sonny were plucked from the project room and sat in the meeting room and given a rather intriguing proposition to build boxie.</p>
    <p>* Adon and Vaughn suggest the idea and making it with micro-controllers and raspberry pi, I go back to the project room brainstorm some ideas on how this can work on some pad and on the net. I realize we are going to need a bunch of extra things like camera, lights, speaker etc. Understanding with first hand experience how there is no room in the time frame for that kind of budgeting or build operation I raise the point of using a red bot and android smart phone to work in tandem. I feel I warm everyone up to the idea because it makes the job more realistic in the time-frame. we start to work on that idea.</p>
<img src="photos/" class="img-responsive" alt="">
<hr>

<h4>Week 14</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
    <p>* throughout the weekend I worked on an interesting way to utilize some of the smart phones inbuilt sensors and software such as the face-tracker app.</p>
    <p>* meet with nigel the man who prompted the groups creation to guage what he would like.</p>
    <p>* PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT talk with the farmbot group to students as they walk in about the project.</p>
<img src="photos/" class="img-responsive" alt="">
<hr>

<h4>Week 15</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
    <p>* Ning and sonny already spearheading the redbot code, seeing as it is pretty trivial I leave it to there capable hands.</p>
    <p>* me and sonny start work on a prototype body for boxie. its pretty bad but we get a good vibe for what we need.</p>
    <p>* im having some difficulty figuring out how to hold the phone and open it back up again. salvation comes when shortening Farmbot stepper motor box.</p>
<img src="photos/" class="img-responsive" alt="">
<hr>

<h4>Week 16</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
    <p>* All is going well when me and sonny think we find a pretty good way of meeting the body requirements for boxie with some spare boxes, spare polystyrene inserts and assorted materials strewn about in the project room.</p>
    <p>* As Boxie rambles about the pen, Adon gets excited and throws us another curve ball when he asks for a swiveling head, we say thats easy and sonny slaps a servo on and we fashion out a place for it. Hey presto it works, until it decapitates itself with its own momentum. hopefully some strong super-glue will do the trick. buying some in preparation I stow it away in the project room until I know well and good the head can stay attached</p>
    <p>* Thursday and Boxie looks like The real McCoy, zipped up and ready for business. Things are falling into place unexpectedly well...</p>
    <p>* Friday dawns, Murphy's law is in full effect and trepidation starts to flow over me, seems like everything goes awry code wise, sonny and Ning are having some conflicts over the code, I try to make heads or tails of the situation but I honestly think its a bit dangerous to throw my hat into the ring when everyones wound up so tight. Ning seems to shoulder the burden So I decide to get on to it with a fresh head in the morning and suggest the same.</p>
    <p>* TechWeek arrives on the cool Saturday morning, I meander into tech and learn Ning the poor dude hasn't slept yet! but that glorious son of a gun seemed to get it working for the most part, apart from the servo going haywire I'm grateful for all his effort. with time a precious commodity I slap Boxie together and glue the head on in hopes of a strong bond and bound down to the hub. Head falls off almost immediately. I'm sweating profusely, so I run Boxie back down to the hardware room where I fire up the gun and glue the head mounts directly onto the body. after the myriad apologies to the group, the day seemed to go alright, we actually produced something in a tight time frame with minimal resources and guidance, and I'm proud of everyone for doing what they did.</p>

<h4>Week 17</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
    <p>* after a month, its back to the old axe and grindstone, we find out from the other Farmbot members that it happens to be the Arduino mega causing the difficult connectivity complications. so I fire up the server and we all post up around Sam and give him some time to sweet talk the raspberry pi into communicating. Turns out the sly dog was dropping a "http://" into the ip address field, seems to coerce the mega and pi to start working together, unfortunately after this accomplishment its main functions remained a locked mystery to us for the proceeding hours.</p>
    <p>* Adon updates me on whats happening with the boxie or "DOT" robot. turns out were going to refine and show it off at showcase in a few weeks time. Oh lord, I hope it goes smoother this time.</p>
    <p>* On a side-note I was also requested to display some of the web 3 visualization site, no problem... hopefully</p>

<h4>Week 18</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
    <p>* So I come back and Adon seems to have advised and implemented with Ning my old dead-man switch idea for Boxie, I'm a big fan. not only does it free up the light sensor problems I suggested the idea a month ago :3, enough self praise aside it works much better despite a few foibles associated with the new code. we all start to look at it and throw in our 2 cents we come up with some more refined states for DOT's stop and drive function.</p>
    <p>* I construct a new head for DOT as the other one is looking very decrepit. its getting more difficult to find cardboard, I'm very glad we had adopted the android and red bot system or else we wouldn't have gotten anywhere near to the tech expo due to lack of funding to even buy glue sticks or cardboard.</p>

<h4>Week 19</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
    <p>* PROFFESIONAL DEVELOPMENT I did the diversity course.</p>
    <p>Things never go swimmingly for long, Adon saunters into the room suggests another box for a cleaner design, I agree, although suggesting to revitalize the existing box instead as it is now a tailor fit for the hot glued mess of the red bot. I avert my gaze for mere seconds (rookie mistake) only to regain visual contact with the now mutilated cardboard box. As I clutch the desecrated remains of DOT's body Adon laughs maniacally, slowly descending into a fiery pentagram etched into the lino below, he recites an omelette idiom in Latin backwards before disappearing from sight.</p>
    <p>So I get to work on the new body it takes me a little box creation investigation, but it turns out quite nice, Adon was right, it looks a lot cleaner than the last iteration.</p>
    <p>I fashion up some more cardboard peripherals to help contain the batteries on the back of dot since the last batteries where mounted on the top limiting DOT's servo motion, I then attach the new head to the new servo mount with glue. I sure hope it remains attached, its really quite perplexing to find a structurally sound solution to something made of paper on a $0 budget.</p>
    <p>After gluing the battery-pack on I ran DOT around the pen with all her limbs attached. For the most part I think it was running well enough, although, I couldn't help notice small twitches coming from the head mounted servo, that also wasn't completely center... I'm holding onto the hope it was resulting in this because the body wasn't actually fixed to the red bot frame yet. I sure hope things don't pan out in the same manner as last time.</p>
    <p>Only one thing to do now, mount the body to the chassis, thing is, i cant use zip ties. To make this unit look cleaner I'm going to glue it straight on, and theres no room for error. After triple checking the bots code and wiring i attach a small USB cable to the red bot just in case we need to make any modifications to the code, we can do so in a pinch. I warm up the glue gun and get ready for some precision gluing. The glue starts to spout out and I'm covering the supports in a small layer first, then of course, the gun starts to excrete glue out of the wrong hole. So the gun seizes up rendering the tool useless. Nevertheless there is still glue so i press the box on top and hope that it was enough to survive the showcase.</p>

<h4>Showcase</h4>
<hr class="hr-secondary">
    <p>The dreaded showcase was now upon us. Coming into polytechnic early to assess the situation before Showcase, I find that the bot had been tampered with and the head was now quite loose. With the head already attached to the metal bracket there was no way to tighten the servo screw anchoring the head in place. Still much time before the showcase I feel i can apply a generous amount of glue to the problem area and settle the matter. Layering on copious amounts of super glue and scratching up a "DO NOT TOUCH" sign I return home to fulfill one of the hardest tasks of the evening, finding something appropriate to wear. </p>
    <p>Adorning a ragtag assortment of what some may call formal wear I step through to the hardware room to find someone has completely disregard the integrity of a mans sign and removed DOT from the room. Finding DOT and inspecting the head area, i come to the realization that the glue has not set properly, beads of sweet appear upon my brow. Out of time and out of super glue i frantically search the hardware room in hopes of a solution. Salvation arrives in the form of an identical hot glue gun to my now broken one. With the head again supported with a ridiculous amount of glue, I don my dinner jacket and swiftly pull up my web 3 visualization site, good thing I spent a bit of time preparing it before the event.</p>
    <p>All in all the event was above satisfactory, with DOT's head issues mitigated i was free to mingle and catch up with some old graduates of the B.I.T and observe a number of fine student works. Whilst explaining the inner machinations of my web 3 assignment to some previous graduates of OP, Adon interjects with a challenge to cripple my website. Although I'm sure given enough time they could bring the website to its knees I was grilled and pressed by some of the best students OP has seen, and I feel I and my website held up quite well, certainly filling me with a sense of pride. With guests and alcoholic beverages dwindling I felt it was time for me to also withdraw for the night</p>
